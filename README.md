# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is a branch of computer science involved in the designing, building, testing and mainataining of softwares.
  **Importance in the technology industry:**
    It ensures innovation in technology
    Proper software engineering principles ensure reliability of software
    It leads to decrease time required for developing software
    

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  Mastering process: Ensure correctness
  Mastering complexity: Expanding data and functional convergence
  Mastering machine: Hardware dependent high level languages 
  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Plan: The development teams collects reuirements from the stakeholders
  Design: Software engineers analyze the requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software
  Implement: The development team codes the product
  Test: The development team combines automation and manual testing to test the software for bugs
  Deploy: The software is moved to a production environment for customers to use
  Maintain: The team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes as well as monitoring the overall system performance, security, and user experience to     identify new ways to improve the existing software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is appropriate where requirements are well defined and unlikely to change while agile is appropriate where requirements are dynamic.
  Waterfall is suitable for projects that are not complex while Agile is suitable for complex projects with high uncertainty


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   **Software Developer**
     Creator of software by writing, testing and mainatining code
   **Quality Assurance Engineer**
     Ensures the software meets quality standards and functions as intended.
   **Project Manager**
     Oversees the projectâ€™s planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring it meets goals on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments** 
  Vscode
**Version Control Systems (VCS)**
  GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
