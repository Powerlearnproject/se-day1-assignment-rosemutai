Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is a branch of computer science involved in the designing, building, testing and mainataining of softwares.
  **Importance in the technology industry:**
    It ensures innovation in technology
    Proper software engineering principles ensure reliability of software
    It leads to decrease time required for developing software
    

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

  Mastering process: Ensure correctness
  Mastering complexity: Expanding data and functional convergence
  Mastering machine: Hardware dependent high level languages 
  
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Plan: The development teams collects reuirements from the stakeholders
  Design: Software engineers analyze the requirements and identify the best solutions to create the software
  Implement: The development team codes the product
  Test: The development team combines automation and manual testing to test the software for bugs
  Deploy: The software is moved to a production environment for customers to use
  Maintain: The team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes as well as monitoring the overall system performance, security, and user experience to     identify new ways to improve the existing software.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is appropriate where requirements are well defined and unlikely to change while agile is appropriate where requirements are dynamic.
  Waterfall is suitable for projects that are not complex while Agile is suitable for complex projects with high uncertainty


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   **Software Developer**
     Creator of software by writing, testing and mainatining code
   **Quality Assurance Engineer**
     Ensures the software meets quality standards and functions as intended.
   **Project Manager**
     Oversees the projectâ€™s planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring it meets goals on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
**Integrated Development Environments** 
They enhace productivity and efficiency making coding faster.
They have built in debuggers which allow developers to identify and fix errors quickly.
**Example:** Visual Studio, PyCharm, Sublime Text, Jupyter Notebook

**Version Control Systems (VCS)**
They help track changes and history
Enable collaboration since multiple developers can work on a single project simultaneously.
Provides backup and recovery
**Example:** GitHub, Mercurial

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Rapid technonological advancement which put software engineers pressure to stay current
  Balancing work and life
  Time constratints hence making software engineers to work under pressure to beat deadlines
**Strategies to overcome these challenges.**
  Dedicate time to learning e.g online courses
  Set boundaries and take breaks 
  Break the project into smaller tasks with clear milestones e.g using Agile

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
**unit testing**
  Testing individual componnets of a software. It ensures that each module works correctly in isolation.
**integration testing**
  Verifying that the various modules used by a software work well together. It ensures smooth data communication across services.
**system testing**
  Evaluates the entire application as a complete, integrated system. It identifies system-wide issues before deployment.
**acceptance testing**
  Very if a system satisfies the business requirements. Ensures the software solves real-world problems for users.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the process of designing and refining input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models.
**Importances**
It improves response accuracy and relevance
It otimizes AI for Specific Use Cases

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague: "Explain machine learning."
  Improved: "Explain machine learning in simple terms with an example of image recognition."
